If 2 or more groups have the highest number of goals, 5 points will be awarded for selecting any of the groups.\nGoals in Final (Selection 10): 15 points for selecting the correct total number of goals in the final (including extra time, penalty shootout not included).\nGoalscorer (Selection 11): 4 points for every goal scored by your selected goalscorer, not including goal in a penalty shootout.
